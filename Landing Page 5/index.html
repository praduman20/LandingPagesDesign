      <h2>Parallax scrolling website</h2>
      <p>
        A parallax website is a captivating design technique that creates an
        illusion of depth and motion by having different elements on a webpage
        move at varying speeds as the user scrolls. This dynamic effect gives
        the website a visually engaging and interactive feel, enhancing user
        experience and making the content more memorable. Parallax scrolling is
        achieved by layering multiple images or sections on the webpage, each
        with a distinct speed of movement, creating a sense of depth and
        immersion. As the user scrolls, the foreground and background elements
        move at different rates, producing a captivating 3D-like effect that
        adds an extra dimension to the website's storytelling and aesthetics.
        <br /><br />
        To achieve the parallax effect using Vanilla JavaScript, you can listen
        for the 'scroll' event and manipulate the position of the different
        layers based on the scroll position. This involves calculating the
        scroll percentage and applying corresponding translations to the layers.
        By adjusting the CSS properties of the layers, such as 'transform' and
        'background-position', you can create the illusion of depth and
        movement. In React, you can follow a similar approach by utilizing state
        and useEffect to update the layer positions when the user scrolls.
        Additionally, libraries like 'react-scroll-parallax' or 'react-parallax'
        can simplify the implementation by providing pre-built components that
        handle the parallax effect. <br /><br />
        When implementing a parallax website, it's essential to strike a balance
        between aesthetics and usability. While the parallax effect can enhance
        visual appeal, excessive or overly complex parallax scrolling can lead
        to slower page loading times and potential usability issues on mobile
        devices. Therefore, it's crucial to optimize images, use lazy loading
        for large assets, and consider the overall performance impact of the
        parallax animations. Moreover, the content and storytelling on the
        website should align with the parallax effect, creating a seamless and
        engaging user journey. By carefully designing the layers and considering
        the pace of scrolling, a parallax website can effectively communicate
        the desired message or narrative while providing an immersive and
        memorable browsing experience.
